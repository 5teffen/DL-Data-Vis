# Data-Visualisation-Capstone

Advancements in the field of big data have brought on the need for new tools to understand the underlying properties of all this information. Data visualization presents one of the most productive ways of tackling this problem. Our solution focuses on extracting the key features that effectively describe the dataset and visualizing this information on an interactive display.  The fundamental aspect of this design is creating a means for high performance dimensionality reduction. Whilst many solutions exist that use PCA or non-parametric algorithms, they struggle with generalizing to more complex manifolds and sparse data. Therefore, our approach instead makes use of a deep learning architecture. By creating a complex neural network hierarchy we aim to optimize the solution and create a data describing mapping that corresponds to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data itself.
