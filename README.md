Dimensionality reduction has become increasing important in the field of Big Data as it facilitates the visualization, classification, communication, and storage of high-dimensional data. Common methods such PCA and its variants have become insufficient as they are limited to linear orthogonal transformations. Superior performance has been achieved through the use of deep learning and autoencoders. However, across all of these methods the evaluation and interpretability of the feature extraction is limited. This paper introduces a 3D data visualization interface for the depiction and evaluation of dimensionality reduction. A data driven scheme relying on a multi-layer autoencoder architecture is used to generate the underlying mapping from the high dimensional space to the reduced space. The efficacy of the feature extraction process is examined by evaluating data and class property retention through the various functions integrated into the tool. For example, a cluster analysis is used to explore the relative positions of similarly classed datapoints. In addition, the feature space is explored through the generation of custom points using the inverse mapping. Simulation studies on the MNIST dataset are used to exemplify the functionality of the tool.
